# ZXSprite

Sprite editor for creating ZX Spectrum sprites and fonts. 
Exports to various formats will be available for direct use in Z80 assembler files. 
The first output format will produce Zeus dg pseudo operations.

e.g.
```
dg 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
dg 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
dg 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
dg 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
dg 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
dg 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
dg 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
dg 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
```

Work in progress, there's many things to be done yet.
