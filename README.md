# ZXSprite

Sprite editor for creating ZX Spectrum sprites and fonts. 
Exports to various formats will be available for direct use in Z80 assembler files. 
The first one is compatible with the Zeus dg pseudo operation.

e.g.
dg 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
dg 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0

I've plans for defb support and maybe direct binary outputs. 

Work in progress, there's many things to be done yet.
